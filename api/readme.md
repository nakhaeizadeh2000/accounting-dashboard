i need to refactor and change minio-files.service.ts and even other files if are depended to it and my purpose is : 1-> handling all Download and Upload and Preview files without causing to use huge RAM and other Resources 2-> generate tumbnails only for images and for other file types client will use an Icon instead of tumbnail 3-> the max file size or some options like this must be set from .env files (if its set, if not use free default value and set no limitations) not sent from client
and i also answered to below questions that would help for clarifying:

questions:

1. For handling uploads and downloads efficiently, are you currently using streaming across the entire pipeline (client to server to MinIO)? If not, we should refactor to ensure end-to-end streaming to minimize memory usage.
2. For thumbnail generation, it looks like you're currently generating thumbnails for both images and videos. To limit it to only images, we'll need to update the conditions and remove the video thumbnail logic.

Should invalid thumbnail requests (e.g., requesting a thumbnail for a PDF) return an error or just skip thumbnail generation silently?
For non-image files, will the client handle showing a generic icon or should the server send a default "no thumbnail" image?

3. For configuration options like max file size:

Which options should be controlled by .env vs client?
Should the .env options completely override the client options or be treated as defaults that the client can override?
If a client option exceeds an .env limit (e.g., client requests a 10GB maxSizeMB but .env specifies 5GB), should it be an error or just capped at the .env limit?

4. Are there any other resource constraints to consider besides RAM? Any CPU, disk, or network constraints to optimize for?
5. Should any of the refactoring be breaking changes (e.g., removing API options) or should it maintain backward compatibility?
6. Are there any other parts of the minio-files module that need optimization besides the service? For example, do the DTO or controller need updates based on the service changes?
7. What level of logging and error handling should be included? More detailed than current or similar to existing?
8. Is there a preferred code style or naming convention to match? Any linter or formatter settings to be aware of?
9. Should the refactoring prioritize performance, code readability, or future extensibility? Any trade-offs to consider?
10. What's the expected traffic and scale for this service? Any specific performance targets to aim for?

and the answers:

1-> i am not sure about it. check my codes and files to realize this.
2-> just skip thumbnail generation for files but images silently
3-> the options that right now are decided by client must be ignored and remove that mean less options and just some important and meaningful options and most important and rest of options must be adjusted by .env file.
its meanless that client decide the stuff like maxSizeMB cause it could be cheated by users and its not safe
4-> most important thing is RAM but as much as possible its better to take care about rest of resources too
5-> yes it could be
6-> i am not sure. check it out your self and if any other files need you can do it
7-> as much as possible it be detailed is better
8-> it has no matter right now and decide it your self
9-> the priority is like this: performance then future extensibility then code readability
10-> not sure right now. take care of it by your self (decide it yourself)
